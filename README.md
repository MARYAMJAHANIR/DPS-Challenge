# AI Engineering Challenge Project

This repository contains the solution to the AI Engineering Challenge presented by Digital Product School.

## Challenge Details

### Mission 1: Create an AI Model

In this part of the challenge, the goal was to create an AI model using the "Monatszahlen Verkehrsunfälle" Dataset obtained from the München Open Data Portal. The model forecasts the number of accidents per category, specifically for 'Alkoholunfälle' and type 'insgesamt' in the year 2021 and the first month.

### Solution Overview

The solution includes:
- Data preprocessing to handle the dataset and filter records up to the end of 2020.
- Development of the prediction model using [insert the name of the model or technique used].
- Visualization of historical accident counts per category.

### Mission 2: Publish Source Code & Deploy

This part involved:
- Publishing the source code in a GitHub repository, maintaining detailed commits and descriptions for each step.
- Deployment of the model as an endpoint that accepts POST requests with specific JSON body content to retrieve predictions.

## Repository Structure

### Code Structure

Describe how the code is organized in the repository and provide navigation tips for readers.

### Visualizations

Include images or links to visualizations generated during the model development and analysis.

## Deployment Details

### Deployment Platform

State the platform used for deployment (e.g., Glitch, Heroku).

### Endpoint Details

Describe the endpoint created, the input JSON structure, and the response format.

## Sending Details to Digital Product School

The final mission involved making a POST request with specific details to a provided URL. This repository contains the code and deployment details requested.
